    <h1>Me, myself and I</h1>
      <p>I can tell you a little bit about me. I come from Houston, TX where I lived 14 years of my life. I completed elementary, middle, and high school. I graduated High Shcool with honors being top 10% of my class, and suma cum laude. I took some college (2 years), pursuing the career of International Business.
      Unfortunately, I´ve encountered personal challenges that made me decide to move to Mexico City. Getting around in a big city was difficutl and adapting to a completely different lifesytle from Houston (another big city!) was even worse. However,
    my relatives such as cousins, aunts, and uncles help me feel welcome again to the city I was born. I wanted to continue studying, but revalidating them all was really difficult. I can also tell you that I love makeup, high heels, stilettos, boots. I am a very vain person. I really take my time to go out anywhere looking well dressed, and madeup. I worked for different call centers, but I knew I had so much potential, and taking
  calls from angry customers would not help me explode that. I found an outsource company hiring for back office. I really loved that job! Unfortunately, the company that we work for decided to let go. Three months from that, I found this cool program called <a href="http://holacode.com/">HolaCode</a>.
With HolaCode, I discovered an opportunity once in a life time! HolaCode help me learn of a social program who helps returnee migrants get into the tech world. I also noticed that we (returnee migrants) are a community of its own!I want to become a programmer because to be honest with you, great salaries!
I am also good with numbers, math, and becuase coding is everywhere now a days. I hope to become a great programmer, that will know how to solve or/and fix bugs.</p>
