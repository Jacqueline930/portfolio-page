    <h1>Me, myself and I</h1>
      <p>I can tell you a little bit about me. I come from Houston, TX where I lived 14 years of my life. I studied elementary, middle, and high school completed. I took some college (2 years), pursuing the career of International Business.
      Unfortunately, I´ve encountered personal challenges that made me decide to move to Mexico City. Getting around in a big city was difficutl and adaptin to lifestyle that is totally different from Houston (another big city!). However,
    my relatives such as cousing, ants, and uncles help me feel welcome again to the city I was born. I wanted to continue studying, but revalidating them all was really difficult. I worked for different call centers, but I knew I had so much potential, that taking
  calls from angry customers would not help me explode that. I found an outsource company hiring for back office. I really loved that job! Unfortunately, the company that we work for decided to let go. Three months from that, I found this cool program called <a href="http://holacode.com/">HolaCode</a>.
With HolaCode, I discovered an opportunity once in a life time! HolaCode help me learn of a social program who helps returnee migrants get into the tech world. I also noticed that we (returnee migrants) are a community of its own! </p>
